# MedicalBot
This was a learning experience on how the basics of a chatbot worked.
This is a small text based chatbot which works on semantic search and answers questions based on medical info (we trained it with a text file containing malaria based info from the WHO website).
The model used was Google Flan t5-xxl from Huggingface library
